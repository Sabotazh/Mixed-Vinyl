# Harmonious Development with Symfony 6

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script
for the [Symfony6 Tutorials](https://symfonycasts.com/tracks/symfony) on [SymfonyCasts](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony).

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```bash
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Start the Symfony web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
works even better.

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```bash
symfony serve
```

(If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first).

Now check out the site at `https://localhost:8000`

Have fun!
